## Pods
  - Pods are composable attachments to unit hulls
  - Sizes
    - Small (maps to one side of light class)
    - Medium (maps to one side of medium class)
    - Large (maps to one side of large class)

### Utility
  - Sensor
  - Mining
  - Energy Storage
  - Metal Storage
  - Construction
  - Repair
  - Shield
### Weapon
  - Anti Light (Missile)
  - Anti Medium (Rail Gun)
  - Anti Heavy (Energy)

break out pod and hull manufacturing
hulls
  - armour
nose pods
  - vision
rear pods
  - thrust
  
should nose and rear pods come with the hull?


Small Pods
  - Construction
Medium Pods
  - Construction
  - Can build next level construction pods
Large Pods
  - Construction

Construction pods can
  - build same size and same tech pods
  - next level construction pod of same size
  - build smaller and lower tech pods

Two fundamental resources
Metal and Energy
Energy is produced
Metal is harvested
All resources are local
Metal transport rail guns (max range?)
Energy beaming nodes
Pods need to be attached to a hull to be functional
Pod transport rail guns
