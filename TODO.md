render a ship with java canvas

1.1
- ship navigates to mouse click
  - update state to have the ship have a target coordinate
  - if theres a target coordinate but not a route plan
  - plan route
  - if theres a planned route execute planned route
  - on successful completetion on route plan kill the target coordinate
- two ships
  - toggle selection (Next / Previous)
  - each navigate to their target location (target location stored on ship)
- two ships engage with each other
- write a daily development log


going to have to do at some point in the near future
  - smarter / lazier rendering
  - switch to svg rather than png
  - event queue
  - fork physics loop, route planning loop, rendering loop, user input loop?

refactor sprite generation world
commit sprite generation
clean up readme and other notes and project.clj
think about process of pod / hull manufacturing and connection
render a unit in a game loop
unit selection and unit moving from point to point
think about the map, collections of systems with resources (20 - 50 ish systems) movement is realtime no worm hole shit
